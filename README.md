# hello-world

Hi people of the tech world!

Steph here, I am the greatest basketball player on the planet, not due to my freakish body type, I actually have an average build. I am the best due to my deliberate rigourus practice routine and my commitment to improving everyday. 

I will apply those traits about me to learn how to become a code jedi! be prepared for pownage!
